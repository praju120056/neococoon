# NeoCocoon: Smart Baby Incubator System

A smart, affordable, and remotely monitorable **baby incubator system** designed to improve neonatal care accessibility. Built with embedded hardware integration and a web-based monitoring dashboard, NeoCocoon offers real-time vitals tracking and environmental control for premature and at-risk infants.

---

## Features

Real-time monitoring of **temperature**, **humidity**, **phototherapy**, and **white light levels**  
User interface built with **Tkinter + TTKBootstrap** for Raspberry Pi touchscreen control  
Serial communication with onboard sensors and actuators via **Raspberry Pi Pico**  
Data visualization and control feedback via an integrated web dashboard (planned)  
Scalable architecture for hospital-grade or home setups

## How It Works

1. **Sensors connected to Raspberry Pi Pico** measure environmental vitals.
2. Data is transmitted via **serial communication** to the Raspberry Pi.
3. **Raspberry Pi UI (Tkinter + TTKBootstrap)** visualizes sensor values and allows adjusting light levels and temperature settings.
4. Control commands are sent back via serial to adjust actuators like heaters, humidifiers, and phototherapy lamps.
5. (Planned) Data can be logged and remotely monitored via a **web dashboard**.
